Code used in Walker et.al journal/conference papers
===================================================

geotecha is very much a code repository for Dr Rohan Walker.  As such you can
code used in his (and collaborators) journal/conference papers.  Rohan
started off coding in Excel VBA, and not all his code has made it over
to python (yet??).  Below is a list of Dr Rohan Walker's publications.
If they are bolded then you will find code within geotecha
that is applicable.

There are also many implementations of other people's research papers
in geotecha.  These are not listed below but can be found by looking
through the api docs.  Many are related to soil consolidation applications.
